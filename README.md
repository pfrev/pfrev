### Hi there, I'm Paulo ðŸ‘‹

### I am a student from Germany, who just discovered the world of coding.

- ðŸ”­ I worked on two Python projects, one focused on DataScience and one focused on AI, getting to know the workflow of coding.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Stata.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Botanically speaking there are no vegetables, we completely made up that category!
